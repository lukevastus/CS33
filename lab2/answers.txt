1. The mathematical answer is -2305843009802285360 which corresponds to 0xdffffffdceaed0. From the trace it can be identified that when this correct resutl is stored in %rbp, the instruction lea 0x2(,%rbp,4),%rax attempts to multiply the result by 4, add 2 and then store it in %rax. However, this causes overflow because the result cannnot be represented in 64 bits. Thus, the final answer in %rax is incorrect.

2. According to the emacs source code in data.c, this is the "smallest value that is representable in a Lisp integer", which equates to -2^61 because lisp integers on a 64-bit platform has 62 bits. 

3. The arith_driver function in data.c calls the INT_MULTIPLY_WRAPV macro which stores the wraparound value of multiplication. When overflow occurs it only gives the lower 64 bits of the mathematical answer.

4. The same result should be produced because -fwrapv and the macro in question 3 both let arithmetic operations wrap around. 

5. A "segmentation fault" is produced.
