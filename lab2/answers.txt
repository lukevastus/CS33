1. The mathematical answer of 1250284240 * -1844255039 is -2305843009802285360, which cannot be represented as a 64-bit signed integer. The imul instruction in the assembly multiplies 1250284240 and -1844255039 and attempts to store the answer in a 64-bit register. Overflow occurs and only the lower 64 bits are taken.

2. According to the emacs source code in data.c, this is the "smallest value that is representable in a Lisp integer", which equates to -2^61 because lisp integers on 64-bit platforms have 62 bits.
