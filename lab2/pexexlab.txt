Part I. Gather instruction traces

1. On lnxsrv07, enter the command:
gdb ~eggert/bin64/bin/emacs-25.2
(gdb) set disassemble-next-line on

2. Set a breakpoint at Ftimes funciton by:
(gdb) break Ftimes

The shell output: Breakpoint 1 at 0x547ad0: file data.c, line 2815.

3. Run the executable by entering: 
(gdb) run -Q -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 -1844255039))'

The program runs and breaks at the beginning of Ftimes function

4. Repeatedly:
   use stepi to get the disassembled code
   use info registers to get the values in the general purpose registers

5. When the first retq command is met, enter:
   continue
   The shell output: 

   Continuing.

2305843008625102544
[Thread 0x7ffff7faaa40 (LWP 5233) exited]
[Inferior 1 (process 5233) exited normally]

6. Rerun the program using run -Q -batch -eval '(print (* 1250284240 -1844255039))' and continue to check the answer. The same output was produced.
